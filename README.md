## About

Quantum is an aggregator service which collects messages from different sources
and publish them through an REST API. There is already a Feed, GitHubCommit 
and MailImap worker to collect messages. At the moment Quantum is in beta phase.
If you have found bugs or want to make an feature request please use the issue
tracker. NOTE Quantum was designed to run in an network which is not reachable
from the internet because of that Quantum has no authentication mechanism 
whatsoever so DO NOT START QUANTUM ON AN SERVER WHICH IS REACHABLE FROM THE 
INTERNET. Here some screenshots of the webinterface:
